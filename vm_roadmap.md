# roadmap for Vortex VM (Stack-Based VM in Rust)

## 🎯 Current Status (v2.0)
A fully-featured **32-bit stack-based virtual machine** written in Rust with comprehensive instruction set, label support, memory operations, and extensive testing.

**✅ Completed Features:**
- Complete arithmetic operations (immediate & stack forms)
- Stack manipulation operations
- Control flow with conditional jumps
- Memory operations (read/write)
- I/O operations (character output)
- Label-based assembly language
- Inline comment support
- Comprehensive test suite (60+ tests)
- CI/CD pipeline

## 🛠️ Previous Phases (All Completed)5

### Phase 1 — Core VM Engine ✅
- [x] Define the VM struct with stack, instruction pointer, and program storage
- [x] Implement main execution loop with `Ret` termination
- [x] Basic instruction dispatch system

### Phase 2 — Stack Operations ✅
- [x] `Push(i32)` - Push immediate values to stack
- [x] `Pop` - Remove top value from stack
- [x] `Dup` - Duplicate top value
- [x] `Swap` - Exchange top two values
- [x] Unit tests for all stack operations

### Phase 3 — Arithmetic Operations ✅
- [x] **Immediate forms**: `AddS(i32)`, `SubS(i32)`, `MultS(i32)`, `DivS(i32)`
- [x] **Stack forms**: `Add`, `Sub`, `Mult`, `Div`
- [x] Safe division by zero handling
- [x] Unit tests for arithmetic operations

### Phase 4 — Control Flow ✅
- [x] `Jiz(addr)` - Jump if zero (conditional jump)
- [x] `Jnz(addr)` - Jump if not zero (conditional jump)
- [x] `Ret` - Program termination
- [x] Loop program testing and validation

### Phase 5 — Memory & I/O Operations ✅
- [x] `MemWrite(addr, values...)` - Write values to memory
- [x] `MemWriteS(addr, len)` - Write stack values to memory
- [x] `MemRead(addr)` - Read value from memory to stack
- [x] `Print(addr, len)` - Output characters from memory
- [x] 2048 addressable memory locations

### Phase 6 — Assembly Language Features ✅
- [x] **Labels** - Named jump targets (`main:`, `loop:`)
- [x] **Inline comments** - Comments on same line as instructions
- [x] **Case-insensitive** instruction parsing
- [x] **Two-pass parser** with label resolution

### Phase 7 — Quality Assurance ✅
- [x] **Comprehensive testing** - 32 total tests (16 unit + 16 integration)
- [x] **Multiple example programs** demonstrating all features
- [x] **CI/CD pipeline** with GitHub Actions
- [x] **Complete documentation** in README

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### Phase 8 — Advanced Features
- [ ] **Simple assembler** - Text to bytecode compiler
- [ ] **Function calls** - Call/return with call stack
- [ ] **Extended types** - Boolean and string support
- [ ] **Structured data** - Arrays and structures
- [ ] **Error handling** - Better error reporting and recovery

### Phase 9 — Performance & Optimization
- [ ] **Bytecode optimization** - Dead code elimination
- [ ] **JIT compilation** - Dynamic code generation
- [ ] **Profiling tools** - Performance analysis
- [ ] **Memory management** - Garbage collection

### Phase 10 — Ecosystem & Tools
- [ ] **Debugger** - Step-through execution
- [ ] **Disassembler** - Bytecode to assembly
- [ ] **IDE integration** - VS Code extension
- [ ] **Package ecosystem** - Third-party libraries
